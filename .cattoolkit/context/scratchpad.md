# Plugin Tools Reorganization Session

## Problem Statement
**Root Issue**: Too many overlapping tools across plugins
**Specific Focus**: Overlapping capabilities causing confusion
**Desired Solution**: Create taxonomy/structure to organize existing tools

## Clarification Summary
- 5-Whys: Root problem = overlapping tools
- Pareto: 80% of confusion from overlapping capabilities
- Eisenhower: Important but not urgent (strategic improvement)
- Via Negativa: Approach = create taxonomy rather than consolidate/remove

## Next Steps Needed
1. Inventory current plugins and their tools
2. Map overlapping capabilities
3. Design taxonomy framework
4. Implement reorganization plan
