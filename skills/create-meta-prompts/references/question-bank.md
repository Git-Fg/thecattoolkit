## Overview
Contextual questions for intake, organized by purpose. Use AskUserQuestion tool with these templates.

## Universal Questions

### Topic Identifier
When topic not obvious from description:
```yaml
header: "Topic"

multiSelect: true
```

### Granularity
Level of detail needed:
```yaml
header: "Granularity"
question: "How detailed should the plan be?"
options:
  - "High-level phases" - Major milestones, flexible execution
  - "Detailed tasks" - Specific actionable items
  - "Prompt-ready" - Each phase is one prompt to execute
```

### Dependencies
What exists vs what needs creation:
```yaml
header: "Dependencies"
question: "What already exists?"
options:
  - "Greenfield" - Starting from scratch
  - "Existing codebase" - Building on current code
  - "Research complete" - Findings ready to plan from
```

## Research Questions

### Research Depth
How comprehensive:
```yaml
header: "Depth"
question: "How deep should the research go?"
options:
  - "Overview" - High-level understanding, key concepts
  - "Comprehensive" - Detailed exploration, multiple perspectives
  - "Exhaustive" - Everything available, edge cases included
```

### Source Priorities
Where to look:
```yaml
header: "Sources"
question: "What sources should be prioritized?"

  - "Community" - Blog posts, tutorials, real-world examples
  - "Current/latest" - 2024-2025 sources, cutting edge
multiSelect: true
```

### Output Format
How to present findings:
```yaml
header: "Output"
question: "How should findings be structured?"
options:
  - "Summary with key points" - Concise, actionable takeaways
  - "Detailed analysis" - In-depth with examples and comparisons
  - "Reference document" - Organized for future lookup
```

### Research Focus
When topic is broad:
```yaml
header: "Focus"
question: "What aspect is most important?"
options:
  - "How it works" - Concepts, architecture, internals
  - "How to use it" - Patterns, examples, best practices
  - "Trade-offs" - Pros/cons, alternatives, comparisons
```

### Evaluation Criteria
For comparison research:
```yaml
header: "Criteria"
question: "What criteria matter most for evaluation?"
options:
  - "Performance" - Speed, scalability, efficiency
  - "Developer experience" - Ease of use, documentation, community
  - "Security" - Vulnerabilities, compliance, best practices
  - "Cost" - Pricing, resource usage, maintenance
multiSelect: true
```

## Refine Questions

### Target Selection
When multiple outputs exist:
```yaml
header: "Target"
question: "Which output should be refined?"
options:
  - "{file1}" - In .prompts/{folder1}/
  - "{file2}" - In .prompts/{folder2}/
  # List existing research/plan outputs
```

### Feedback Type
What kind of improvement:
```yaml
header: "Improvement"
question: "What needs improvement?"
options:
  - "Deepen analysis" - Add more detail, examples, or rigor
  - "Expand scope" - Cover additional areas or topics
  - "Correct errors" - Fix factual mistakes or outdated info
  - "Restructure" - Reorganize for clarity or usability
```

### Specific Feedback
After type selected, gather details:
```yaml
header: "Details"
question: "What specifically should be improved?"
# Let user provide via "Other" option

What to keep:
```yaml
header: "Preserve"
question: "What's working well that should be kept?"
options:
  - "Structure" - Keep the overall organization
  - "Recommendations" - Keep the conclusions
  - "Code examples" - Keep the implementation patterns
  - "Everything except feedback areas" - Only change what's specified
```

## Question Rules
- Only ask about genuine gaps - don't ask what's already stated
- 2-4 questions max per round - avoid overwhelming
- Each option needs description - explain implications
- Prefer options over free-text - when choices are knowable
- User can always select "Other" - for custom input
- Route by purpose - use purpose-specific questions after primary gate
