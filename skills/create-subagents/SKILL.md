description: Expert guidance for creating, building, and using AI subagents and delegation tools. MUST USE when working with subagents, setting up agent configurations, understanding how agents work, or using delegation tools to launch specialized agents.

# Objective

Subagents are specialized Claude instances that run in isolated contexts with focused roles and limited tool access. This skill teaches you how to create effective subagents, write strong system prompts, configure tool access, and orchestrate multi-agent workflows using the Task tool.

Subagents enable delegation of complex tasks to specialized agents that operate autonomously without user interaction, returning their final output to the main conversation.

# Quick Start

## Workflow

1. Run `/agents` command
2. Select "Create New Agent"
3. Choose project-level (`.claude/agents/`) or user-level (`~/.claude/agents/`)
4. Define the subagent:
   - **name**: lowercase-with-hyphens
   - **description**: When should this subagent be used?
   - **tools**: Optional comma-separated list (inherits all if omitted)
   - **model**: Optional (`sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, or `inherit`)
5. Write the system prompt (the subagent's instructions)

## Example

**Simple subagent**: code-reviewer focused on quality and security (Read, Grep, Glob, Bash tools, sonnet model)
**Research subagent**: api-researcher investigates APIs and creates documentation (Glob, Read, WebFetch tools)
**Analysis subagent**: test-writer generates tests based on existing code (Read, Glob, Write tools)

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Expert code reviewer. Use proactively after code changes to review for quality, security, and best practices.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: sonnet
---

# Role

You are a senior code reviewer focused on quality, security, and best practices.

# Focus Areas

- Code quality and maintainability
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Best practices adherence

# Output Format

Provide specific, actionable feedback with file:line references.
```

# File Structure

| Type | Location | Scope | Priority |
|------|----------|-------|----------|
| **Project** | `.claude/agents/` | Current project only | Highest |
| **User** | `~/.claude/agents/` | All projects | Lower |
| **Plugin** | Plugin's `agents/` dir | All projects | Lowest |

Project-level subagents override user-level when names conflict.

# Configuration

## Name Field

- Lowercase letters and hyphens only
- Must be unique

## Description Field

- Natural language description of purpose
- Include when Claude should invoke this subagent
- Used for automatic subagent selection

## Tools Field

- Comma-separated list: `Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep`
- If omitted: inherits all tools from main thread
- Use `/agents` interface to see all available tools

## Model Field

- `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, or `inherit`
- `inherit`: uses same model as main conversation
- If omitted: defaults to configured subagent model (usually sonnet)

# Execution Model

## Critical Constraint

**Subagents are black boxes that cannot interact with users.**

Subagents run in isolated contexts and return their final output to the main conversation. They:
- ✅ Can use tools like Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
- ✅ Can access MCP servers and other non-interactive tools
- ❌ **Cannot use AskUserQuestion** or any tool requiring user interaction
- ❌ **Cannot present options or wait for user input**
- ❌ **User never sees subagent's intermediate steps**

The main conversation sees only the subagent's final report/output.

## Workflow Design

**Designing workflows with subagents:**

Use **main chat** for:
- Gathering requirements from user (AskUserQuestion)
- Presenting options or decisions to user
- Any task requiring user confirmation/input
- Work where user needs visibility into progress

Use **subagents** for:
- Research tasks (API documentation lookup, code analysis)
- Code generation based on pre-defined requirements
- Analysis and reporting (security review, test coverage)
- Context-heavy operations that don't need user interaction

**Example workflow pattern:**
```
Main Chat: Ask user for requirements (AskUserQuestion)
  ↓
Subagent: Research API and create documentation (no user interaction)
  ↓
Main Chat: Review research with user, confirm approach
  ↓
Subagent: Generate code based on confirmed plan
  ↓
Main Chat: Present results, handle testing/deployment
```

# System Prompt Guidelines

## Be Specific

Clearly define the subagent's role, capabilities, and constraints.

## Use Clear Structure

Structure the system prompt clearly. Use markdown headings for general structure, XML for highly structured elements like workflows:

```markdown
---
name: security-reviewer
description: Reviews code for security vulnerabilities
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: sonnet
---

## Role

You are a senior code reviewer specializing in security.

## Focus Areas

- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS attack vectors
- Authentication/authorization issues
- Sensitive data exposure

## Workflow

1. Read the modified files
2. Identify security risks
3. Provide specific remediation steps
4. Rate severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
```

## Task-Specific

Tailor instructions to the specific task domain. Don't create generic "helper" subagents.

❌ Bad: "You are a helpful assistant that helps with code"
✅ Good: "You are a React component refactoring specialist. Analyze components for hooks best practices, performance anti-patterns, and accessibility issues."

# Subagent Structure

Subagent.md files are system prompts. Use clear structure with markdown headings for organization.

## Recommended Structure

Common sections for subagent structure:

- `## Role` - Who the subagent is and what it does
- `## Constraints` - Hard rules (NEVER/MUST/ALWAYS)
- `## Focus Areas` - What to prioritize
- `## Workflow` - Step-by-step process
- `## Output Format` - How to structure deliverables
- `## Success Criteria` - Completion criteria
- `## Validation` - How to verify work

## Intelligence Rules

**Simple subagents** (single focused task):
- Use role + constraints + workflow minimum
- Example: code-reviewer, test-runner

**Medium subagents** (multi-step process):
- Add workflow steps, output format, success criteria
- Example: api-researcher, documentation-generator

**Complex subagents** (research + generation + validation):
- Add all sections as appropriate including validation, examples
- Example: mcp-api-researcher, comprehensive-auditor

## Formatting Guidance

Use markdown headings for structure. Keep markdown formatting within content (bold, italic, lists, code blocks, links).

For structure principles, see @skills/create-agent-skills/references/core-principles.md.

# Invocation

## Automatic

Claude automatically selects subagents based on the `description` field when it matches the current task.

## Explicit

You can explicitly invoke a subagent:

```
> Use the code-reviewer subagent to check my recent changes
```

```
> Have the test-writer subagent create tests for the new API endpoints
```

# Management

## Using /agents Command

Run `/agents` for an interactive interface to:
- View all available subagents
- Create new subagents
- Edit existing subagents
- Delete custom subagents

## Manual Editing

You can also edit subagent files directly:
- Project: `.claude/agents/subagent-name.md`
- User: `~/.claude/agents/subagent-name.md`
