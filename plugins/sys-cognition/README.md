# sys-cognition

**Brain Layer** - Thinking frameworks, prompt engineering, and context management for the Cat Toolkit.

## Purpose

Provides the cognitive infrastructure: structured reasoning frameworks, prompt optimization, session consolidation, and persistent context management.

## Agents

- **strategist** - Detached reasoning engine for deep analysis (read-only)
- **prompt-engineer** - Prompt design with Complexity-Based Guidance Framework
- **scribe** - Background context processor for session state and handoffs

## Skills

- **thinking-frameworks** - 12 structured frameworks (Strategic, Prioritization, Problem Analysis)
- **deep-analysis** - Applies comprehensive frameworks to complex problems
- **prompt-engineering** - Draft, optimize, and audit prompts with full library
- **context-engineering** - Persistent session state management and handoffs
- **summarize-session** - Session consolidation and health metrics
- **prepare-handoff** - Structured context transfer between sessions

## Usage

Strategist operates in `plan` mode for safe analysis. Prompt-engineer uses XML/Markdown decision rules. Scribe runs in background for context persistence. All frameworks are passive knowledge until invoked.

## Core Frameworks

- **Strategic** - Long-term planning and positioning
- **Prioritization** - Impact vs urgency matrices
- **Problem Analysis** - Root cause and solution mapping
- **Complexity-Based Guidance** - Dynamic prompt depth based on task complexity
