## Objective
Create a detailed implementation strategy for: $ARGUMENTS

This ensures complex tasks are approached systematically with proper planning.

## Process
1. Break down task into phases
2. Identify dependencies between phases
3. Estimate complexity for each phase
4. Suggest optimal approach
5. Identify potential risks

## Success Criteria
- Task broken into clear phases
- Dependencies mapped
- Complexity estimated
- Optimal approach identified
- Risks and mitigations outlined
```
