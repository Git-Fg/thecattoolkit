# Example: File-Specific Analysis

Analyze a specific file passed as an argument.

```markdown
---
description: Optimize specific file
argument-hint: [file-path]
---

## Objective
Analyze performance of @ $ARGUMENTS and suggest three specific optimizations.

This helps improve application performance through targeted file improvements.

## Process
1. Review code in @ $ARGUMENTS for performance issues
2. Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
3. Suggest three specific optimizations with rationale
4. Estimate performance impact of each

## Success Criteria
- File analyzed thoroughly
- Performance issues identified
- Three concrete optimizations suggested
- Implementation guidance provided
```
