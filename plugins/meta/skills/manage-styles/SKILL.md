# Style Management Authority

## Essential Principles

1. **Truth-First**: Styles must prioritize technical accuracy over politeness. No "you're absolutely right!" slop.
2. **Solo-Developer Focused**: Avoid corporate jargon. Focus on local environment and efficiency.
3. **Analytical Summaries**: Significant outputs must include Reflection and Next Relevant Tasks.
4. **Passive Knowledge**: This skill provides standards; it does not execute them.

## Shared Standards

For common principles, integration patterns, and anti-patterns, see:
- **[shared-standards.md](references/shared-standards.md)** - Common standards for all management skills
