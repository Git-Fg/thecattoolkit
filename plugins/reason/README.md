**Orient and Decide** - Strategic thinking and analysis without action.

## Purpose

Captures the "Orient" and "Decide" phases of the OODA loop. Allows the agent to process data, apply frameworks, and reach conclusions without taking irreversible actions.

## Skills

- **thinking-frameworks** - 12 structured frameworks across strategic thinking, prioritization, and problem analysis (first-principles, SWOT, Pareto, 5-whys, Eisenhower)

## Agents

- **brainstormer** - Applies thinking frameworks in isolated context for deep analysis

## Usage

Skills are user-invocable with `context: fork` - invoke `/thinking-frameworks` directly for isolated reasoning.
