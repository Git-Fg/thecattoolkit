# execute

**Act Phase** - Where file modifications and irreversible actions happen.

## Purpose

The execution engine for the Cat Toolkit. Transforms plans into reality through orchestrated implementation.

## Agents

- **worker** - Universal builder for autonomous implementation (TDD, debugging)
- **architect** - System architecture and design specialist

## Skills

- **execution-core** - Universal behavioral standards (Uninterrupted Flow, Self-Verification, Handoffs)
- **builder-core** - Document templates (BRIEF.md, ROADMAP.md, PLAN.md) and orchestration standards
- **software-engineering** - Engineering protocols (TDD, Debugging, Code Review, Security)
- **architecture** - System design frameworks and ADR documentation

## Commands

- `/plan` - Intelligently routes between autonomous and interactive planning workflows
- `/create-plan` - Autonomous plan creation with codebase investigation
- `/create-plan-interactive` - Interactive planning with deep requirements gathering
- `/run-plan` - Execute project phases via worker agent
- `/manage-plan` - Modify existing plans and update task status

## Usage

The `/plan` command intelligently routes planning workflows based on complexity. Use `/run-plan` to execute phases via the worker agent. All agents operate in Uninterrupted Flow with self-verification.
