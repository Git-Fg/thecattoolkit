# Canvas Design Protocol



## When to Use This Skill

- Creating posters or promotional artwork
- Designing original visual art pieces
- Developing brand visuals or identity elements
- Creating artistic compositions or abstractions
- Producing visual content for presentations or displays
- Generating design-forward artwork with deep conceptual foundations

## Two-Step Process

### Step 1: Design Philosophy Creation

Create a **VISUAL PHILOSOPHY** (aesthetic movement manifesto) that serves as the foundation for all visual decisions.

**Philosophy File Structure:**
- **Movement Naming** (1-2 words): "Brutalist Joy", "Chromatic Silence", "Metabolist Dreams"
- **Philosophical Articulation** (4-6 paragraphs): Emphasize space/form, color/material, scale/rhythm, composition/balance, visual hierarchy

**Critical Guidelines:**
- Avoid redundancy - each design aspect mentioned once with depth
- Emphasize craftsmanship - work should appear meticulously crafted
- Leave creative space - specific enough to guide, open enough for interpretation
- Visual expression priority - ideas communicated through form, not text

See [references/philosophy-examples.md](references/philosophy-examples.md) for complete example structures.

### Step 2: Canvas Creation

Express the design philosophy visually, creating original artwork that embodies the aesthetic principles.

**Visual Creation Principles:**
- Use form, space, color, and composition as primary communication tools
- Create visual hierarchies that guide the eye naturally
- Employ spatial relationships to convey meaning
- Balance positive and negative space with intention

**Typography (Minimal, Essential):**
- Text always minimal and contextually appropriate
- Font selection must be design-forward and visually integrated
- Use different fonts from `./canvas-fonts` directory
- Ensure perfect spacing, alignment, and readability
- Text never overlaps, nothing falls off canvas boundaries



See [references/visual-principles.md](references/visual-principles.md) for detailed guidance.

## File Outputs

1. **Design Philosophy (.md)**: Written manifesto defining the aesthetic movement
2. **Visual Artwork (.png)**: High-resolution raster artwork
3. **Visual Artwork (.pdf)**: Vector-based or high-quality artwork suitable for print

## Execution Process

### 1. Deduce the Subtle Reference

Before creating the canvas, identify the conceptual framework from the request. The design philosophy provides the aesthetic language. The conceptual framework provides the soul woven invisibly into form, color, and composition.

### 2. Canvas Creation

Use the design philosophy as foundation to craft a masterpiece. Create **one single page, highly visual, design-forward output** unless multiple pages requested.

**Composition Techniques:**
- Use repeating patterns and perfect geometric shapes
- Embrace systematic visual language
- Create artifacts proving ephemeral concepts can be studied
- Anchor with simple phrases positioned subtly
- Use limited, intentional color palettes

**Technical Execution:**
- Search and download fonts from `./canvas-fonts` directory as needed
- Make typography part of the art, not typeset digitally
- Push boundaries and aesthetics to frontier
- Follow design instinct guided by philosophy

### 3. Refinement Phase

Quality Standard: Work must be pristine, a masterpiece of craftsmanship, display-worthy.

**Refinement Approach:**
- Don't add more graphics—refine what exists
- Ask: "How can I make what's already here more of a piece of art?"
- Avoid filters or font refactoring
- Make existing composition more cohesive
- Polish details rather than adding elements

## Multi-Page Options

When multiple pages requested, create additional creative pages following the same philosophy but distinctly different. Bundle in single .pdf or multiple .png files.



## Copyright Compliance

**CRITICAL**: Create only original designs. Never copy existing artists' work. This skill produces entirely original artwork inspired by philosophical frameworks, not existing pieces. All visual expression must be created from scratch.

## Common Use Cases

- **Artistic Posters**: Concert posters, event promotions, artistic statements
- **Abstract Compositions**: Purely abstract artwork communicating concepts through color and form
- **Brand Visuals**: Original brand elements, logos, identity systems
- **Presentation Artwork**: Visually striking content for presentations
- **Decorative Art**: Artwork suitable for interior spaces or galleries
