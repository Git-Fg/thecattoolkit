# Advanced Composition Patterns

This document provides advanced composition techniques for creating sophisticated visual artwork.

## Pattern-Based Composition

### Repetition and Variation
- Use repeating elements to create unity
- Introduce variation to maintain interest
- Balance predictability with surprise

### Geometric Systems
- Perfect shapes: circles, squares, triangles
- Grid-based layouts with intentional breaks
- Mathematical proportions (golden ratio, rule of thirds)

## Spatial Organization

### Centralization
- Single focal point at center
- Elements radiate outward
- Creates stability and focus

### Asymmetry
- Off-center focal points
- Dynamic tension through imbalance
- More modern, energetic feel

### Layering
- Foreground, middle ground, background
- Overlapping elements create depth
- Transparency reveals hidden layers

## Visual Flow

### Directional Cues
- Lines guide eye movement
- Arrows, shapes point toward focal points
- Reading direction (left-to-right)

### Rhythm and Movement
- Repeated elements create tempo
- Scale changes suggest motion
- Leading lines direct gaze

## Balance Types

### Symmetrical Balance
- Mirror image across axis
- Formal, stable, traditional
- Can feel static

### Asymmetrical Balance
- Different elements with equal visual weight
- Dynamic, modern, engaging
- More visual interest

### Radial Balance
- Elements radiate from center point
- Creates strong focal point
- Natural, organic feel

## Contrast Techniques

### Scale Contrast
- Large vs small elements
- Creates hierarchy and emphasis

### Color Contrast
- Complementary colors
- Light vs dark values
- Warm vs cool temperatures

### Texture Contrast
- Smooth vs rough surfaces
- Solid vs broken areas
- Creates tactile variety

## Negative Space

### Breathing Room
- Allow space around elements
- Prevents visual clutter
- Creates sophistication

### Active Negative Space
- Shape the voids intentionally
- Space becomes design element
- "Figure-ground" reversal

## Unity Principles

### Proximity
- Related elements grouped together
- Creates visual relationships

### Repetition
- Repeated colors, shapes, textures
- Creates consistency and cohesion

### Continuation
- Lines, edges guide eye through composition
- Creates flow and connection

### Alignment
- Elements aligned to common axis
- Creates order and organization
