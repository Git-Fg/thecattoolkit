# Writing Techniques

## Headlines That Work

```markdown
BAD: "Q4 Sales Analysis"
GOOD: "Q4 Sales Beat Target by 23% - Here's Why"

BAD: "Customer Churn Report"
GOOD: "We're Losing $2.4M to Preventable Churn"

BAD: "Marketing Performance"
GOOD: "Content Marketing Delivers 4x ROI vs. Paid"

Formula:
[Specific Number] + [Business Impact] + [Actionable Context]
```

### Headline Patterns

**The Number-First Pattern:**
- "27% of trials convert within 24 hours"
- "$1.2M in revenue from one feature launch"
- "Customer support time down 60%"

**The Problem-Solution Pattern:**
- "Why customers churn in week 2"
- "The hidden cost of manual processes"
- "What makes enterprise deals close faster"

**The Contrast Pattern:**
- "Self-serve vs. full-service: Which wins?"
- "B2B vs. B2C: Different playbooks needed"
- "What top 1% do differently"

**The Action Pattern:**
- "5 steps to reduce churn by 40%"
- "How to double trial conversion"
- "What we learned from 100 customer interviews"

### Varied Sentence Length

```markdown
Short sentences for impact:
"We missed target by 15%. That's $600K in revenue. We need to act now."

Longer sentences for context:
"After analyzing 6 months of customer data, we identified three key patterns: usage drops significantly after the first week, support tickets cluster around specific features, and expansion revenue correlates directly with onboarding quality."

Mixed for rhythm:
"Revenue is up. Q4 saw $4.2M in total bookings, representing 23% growth quarter-over-quarter. The growth wasn't evenly distributed though - enterprise accounts grew 45% while SMB remained flat at 12%."
```

## Numbers and Metrics

### When to Use Numbers

```markdown
Use specific numbers:
✓ "23% increase" not "significant increase"
✓ "$2.4M in churn" not "substantial revenue loss"
✓ "15 points higher" not "much better"

Use ranges for predictions:
✓ "15-20% improvement expected"
✓ "$400K-$600K potential impact"
✓ "2-3x faster implementation"

Use comparisons:
✓ "2x better than industry average"
✓ "23% above target"
✓ "15 points higher than Q3"
```

### Metric Naming

```markdown
✓ "Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)"
✗ "MRR number"

✓ "Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)"
✗ "CAC metric"

✓ "Net Revenue Retention (NRR)"
✗ "Revenue retention rate"

✗ "Yearly contract value"
```

## Call to Action Patterns
