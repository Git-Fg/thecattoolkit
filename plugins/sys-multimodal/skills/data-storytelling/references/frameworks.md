# Customer Churn Analysis

## The Hook
"We're losing $2.4M annually to preventable churn."

## The Context
- Current churn rate: 8.5% (industry average: 5%)
- Average customer lifetime value: $4,800
- 500 customers churned last quarter

## The Problem
Analysis of churned customers reveals a pattern:
- 73% churned within first 90 days
- Common factor: < 3 support interactions
- Low feature adoption in first month

## The Insight
[Show engagement curve visualization]
Customers who don't engage in the first 14 days
are 4x more likely to churn.

## The Solution
1. Implement 14-day onboarding sequence
2. Proactive outreach at day 7
3. Feature adoption tracking

## Expected Impact
- Reduce early churn by 40%
- Save $960K annually
- Payback period: 3 months

## Call to Action
Approve $50K budget for onboarding automation.

# Market Opportunity Analysis

## The Question

| Factor      | Weight | EMEA Score | APAC Score |
|-------------|--------|------------|------------|
| Market Size | 25%    | 5          | 4          |
| Growth      | 30%    | 3          | 5          |
| Competition | 20%    | 2          | 4          |

APAC first. Higher growth, less competition.
Start with Singapore hub (English, business-friendly).
Enter EMEA in Year 2 with localization ready.

## Risk Mitigation
