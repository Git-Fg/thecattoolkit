# Data Storytelling

Transform raw data into compelling narratives that drive decisions and inspire action.

## When to Use This Skill

- Presenting analytics to executives
- Creating quarterly business reviews
- Building investor presentations
- Writing data-driven reports
- Communicating insights to non-technical audiences
- Making recommendations based on data

## Core Concepts

### 1. Story Structure

```
Setup → Conflict → Resolution

Setup: Context and baseline
Conflict: The problem or opportunity
Resolution: Insights and recommendations
```

### 2. Narrative Arc

```
1. Hook: Grab attention with surprising insight
2. Context: Establish the baseline
3. Rising Action: Build through data points
4. Climax: The key insight
5. Resolution: Recommendations
6. Call to Action: Next steps
```

### 3. Three Pillars

| Pillar | Purpose | Components |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Data** | Evidence | Numbers, trends, comparisons |
| **Narrative** | Meaning | Context, causation, implications |
| **Visuals** | Clarity | Charts, diagrams, highlights |

## Core Frameworks

### Framework 1: Problem-Solution
Identify a problem, show the data revealing root cause, present solution with impact projection.

### Framework 2: Trend Story
Show transformation over time, highlight key turning points, connect to strategic direction.

### Framework 3: Comparison Story
Present multiple options, show analysis framework, recommend with rationale and risk mitigation.

## Visualization Principles

### Choose the Right Chart
- **Comparisons:** Bar charts, stacked bars
- **Trends:** Line charts, area charts, slope charts
- **Relationships:** Scatter plots, bubble charts, heatmaps

### Color Strategy
- **Primary:** #2E86AB (blue)
- **Secondary:** #A23B72 (purple)
- **Accent:** #F18F01 (orange)
- **Alert:** #E63946 (red)
- **Success:** #06A77D (green)

Use accent colors sparingly for emphasis. Gray for non-important elements.

## Best Practices

### Do's
- **Start with the "so what"** - Lead with insight
- **Use the rule of three** - Three points, three comparisons
- **Show, don't tell** - Let data speak
- **Make it personal** - Connect to audience goals
- **End with action** - Clear next steps

### Don'ts
- **Don't data dump** - Curate ruthlessly
- **Don't bury the insight** - Front-load key findings
- **Don't use jargon** - Match audience vocabulary
- **Don't show methodology first** - Context, then method
- **Don't forget the narrative** - Numbers need meaning
