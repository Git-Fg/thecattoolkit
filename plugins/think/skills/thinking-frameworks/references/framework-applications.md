# Framework Application Methodology

This document provides detailed application instructions for each thinking framework. Used by both Sovereign Vector (foreground) and Sovereign Triangle (delegation) patterns.

## Strategic Thinking Frameworks

### First-Principles
**Purpose:** Challenge assumptions, rebuild understanding from fundamentals

**Application Steps:**
1. **Identify the problem** - What are you trying to solve?
2. **Break down to fundamentals** - List the core components, facts, and assumptions
3. **Challenge each assumption** - Is this necessarily true? What if we remove this assumption?
4. **Build from base truths** - Using only what's definitely true, reconstruct the understanding
5. **Generate novel solutions** - Based on the rebuilt foundation, what new approaches emerge?

**Output Structure:**
- Original Problem Statement
- Fundamental Components (bulleted list)
- Challenged Assumptions (cross out invalid ones)
- Base Truths Established
- Novel Solutions Generated
- Recommended Action

**Example Application:**
```
Problem: "Our user engagement is declining"
Break Down:
- User engagement metrics
- User behavior patterns
- Product features
- User demographics
- Market conditions
Challenge: "Is declining engagement necessarily due to product issues?"
Build: Engagement requires value delivery + ease of use + motivation
Solution: Focus on value delivery measurement, not just usage metrics
```

### Inversion
**Purpose:** Identify failure modes to avoid them

**Application Steps:**
1. **State your goal** - What do you want to achieve?
2. **Invert the goal** - What would guarantee failure?
3. **Identify failure points** - What actions would lead to guaranteed failure?
4. **Avoid the opposite** - Do the opposite of failure actions
5. **Build robust approach** - Based on what guarantees failure, build a failure-resistant solution

**Output Structure:**
- Original Goal
- Inverted Goal (Failure Condition)
- Failure Mode Analysis
- Avoidance Strategy
- Robust Solution
- Implementation Plan

### Second-Order Thinking
**Purpose:** Understand cascading consequences and long-term impacts

**Application Steps:**
1. **Identify the decision** - What choice needs to be made?
2. **First-order effects** - What are the immediate consequences?
3. **Second-order effects** - What are the consequences of the consequences?
4. **Third-order effects** - Continue the chain
5. **Analyze the cascade** - How do these effects interact and compound?
6. **Make informed decision** - Based on the full cascade

**Output Structure:**
- Decision Point
- First-Order Effects (immediate)
- Second-Order Effects (short-term consequences)
- Third-Order Effects (long-term cascade)
- Interaction Analysis
- Recommended Decision
- Risk Mitigation

### SWOT Analysis
**Purpose:** Analyze strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats for strategic positioning

**Application Steps:**
1. **Define the scope** - What entity/situation are you analyzing?
2. **Identify Strengths** - Internal positive factors
3. **Identify Weaknesses** - Internal limitations
4. **Identify Opportunities** - External favorable factors
5. **Identify Threats** - External risks
6. **Generate strategies** - Match strengths with opportunities, address weaknesses and threats

**Output Structure:**
- Analysis Scope
- Strengths (internal, positive)
- Weaknesses (internal, negative)
- Opportunities (external, positive)
- Threats (external, negative)
- Strategy Matrix:
  - SO (Strengths + Opportunities)
  - WO (Weaknesses + Opportunities)
  - ST (Strengths + Threats)
  - WT (Weaknesses + Threats)
- Strategic Recommendations

### 10-10-10 Framework
**Purpose:** Evaluate decisions across three time horizons

**Application Steps:**
1. **Frame the decision** - What choice needs to be made?
2. **10 minutes perspective** - How will you feel about this in 10 minutes?
3. **10 months perspective** - How will this impact you in 10 months?
4. **10 years perspective** - How will this affect your life in 10 years?
5. **Synthesize** - Balance across all three horizons
6. **Make decision** - Choose based on holistic time perspective

**Output Structure:**
- Decision Under Consideration
- 10-Minute View:
  - Immediate feelings
  - Quick impact
  - Reversibility
- 10-Month View:

## Prioritization Frameworks

### Pareto Principle (80/20)
**Purpose:** Identify vital few factors that drive majority of results

**Application Steps:**
1. **List all factors** - What are all the inputs, activities, or elements?
2. **Identify impact** - For each factor, what's the impact/outcome it creates?
3. **Rank by impact** - Order from highest to lowest impact
4. **Calculate cumulative impact** - What's the cumulative percentage?
5. **Find the vital 20%** - Which factors create ~80% of results?
6. **Focus recommendations** - Prioritize the vital few

**Output Structure:**
- All Factors Listed
- Impact Assessment (for each factor)
- Ranked List (highest to lowest impact)
- Cumulative Impact Calculation
- Vital Few Identified (20% that create 80%)
- Focus Strategy
- Resource Allocation Recommendations

### One-Thing Method
**Purpose:** Find the single highest-leverage action

**Application Steps:**
1. **Define the goal** - What outcome do you want?
2. **List potential actions** - What could you do?
3. **Identify leverage points** - Which actions have disproportionate impact?
4. **Find the One Thing** - What single action makes everything else easier or unnecessary?
5. **Prioritize ruthlessly** - Focus on the One Thing
6. **Implement** - Do the One Thing first

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Picking something comfortable rather than highest-impact
- Confusing urgent with important
- Selecting too broad an action (not specific enough)
- Abandoning the One Thing when it gets difficult
- Not asking the focusing question recursively (what's the one thing for THIS one thing?)

**Output Structure:**
- Goal Statement
- Potential Actions (comprehensive list)
- Leverage Analysis (impact vs effort for each)
- The One Thing Identified
- Why It's Highest Leverage
- Implementation Plan
- Supporting Actions (if needed)

**Example Application:**
```
Goal: "Increase monthly revenue by 50%"
Potential Actions:
- Launch new product line
- Increase marketing spend
- Hire more salespeople
- Improve conversion rate
- Raise prices
- Expand to new markets
Leverage Analysis:
- Marketing spend: 1.2x return (measured)
- Conversion rate: Currently 2%, industry avg 4%
- New product: 6-month lead time
The One Thing: "Fix the checkout flow to improve conversion rate"
Why: Doubles revenue with existing traffic, no acquisition cost, enables all other growth
Implementation: 2-week sprint focused only on checkout UX
```

### Eisenhower Matrix
**Purpose:** Categorize by urgency vs importance

**Application Steps:**
1. **List all tasks/items** - What needs attention?
2. **Assess urgency** - How time-sensitive is each?
3. **Assess importance** - How important is each to your goal?
4. **Categorize** - Place each in the appropriate quadrant:
   - Q1: Urgent + Important (Do First)
   - Q2: Not Urgent + Important (Schedule)
   - Q3: Urgent + Not Important (Delegate)
   - Q4: Not Urgent + Not Important (Eliminate)
5. **Act on each quadrant** - Specific actions for each category

**Output Structure:**
- All Items Listed
- Urgency Assessment
- Importance Assessment
- Quadrant Categorization:
  - Quadrant 1 (Urgent + Important): Do First
  - Quadrant 2 (Not Urgent + Important): Schedule
  - Quadrant 3 (Urgent + Not Important): Delegate
  - Quadrant 4 (Not Urgent + Not Important): Eliminate
- Action Plan for Each Quadrant
- Time Allocation Recommendation

## Problem Analysis Frameworks

### 5-Whys
**Purpose:** Drill to root cause by asking "why" repeatedly

**Application Steps:**
1. **State the problem** - What is happening?
2. **Ask "why"** - Why is this happening?
3. **Ask "why" again** - Why is that the cause?
4. **Continue drilling** - Ask "why" 5 times or until you reach root cause
5. **Verify root cause** - Does this explain all symptoms?
6. **Recommend solutions** - Address the root cause

**Output Structure:**
- Problem Statement
- Why 1: [First cause]
- Why 2: [Cause of cause 1]
- Why 3: [Cause of cause 2]
- Why 4: [Cause of cause 3]
- Why 5: [Root cause]
- Root Cause Verification
- Solutions Targeting Root Cause
- Implementation Recommendations

### Opportunity-Cost Analysis
**Purpose:** Analyze trade-offs and what you give up

**Application Steps:**
1. **Define the decision** - What choice are you making?
2. **List all options** - What are the alternatives?
3. **Analyze each option** - What do you gain? What do you give up?
4. **Calculate opportunity costs** - What is the value of the next best alternative?
5. **Compare trade-offs** - What are the relative costs and benefits?
6. **Make decision** - Choose based on analysis

### Occam's Razor
**Purpose:** Find simplest explanation that fits all facts

**Application Steps:**
1. **Gather all facts** - What do we know for certain?
2. **List all possible explanations** - What could explain these facts?
3. **Test each explanation** - Does this explain ALL the facts?
4. **Count assumptions** - How many assumptions does each require?
5. **Choose simplest** - The explanation with fewest assumptions is best
6. **Verify** - Does the simplest explanation actually fit all facts?

**Output Structure:**
- Facts Established
- Possible Explanations (list all)
- For Each Explanation:
  - Required Assumptions
  - Facts Explained
  - Facts Not Explained
- Simplest Explanation Selected
- Verification
- Implications
- Action Items

### Via Negativa
**Purpose:** Improve by removing rather than adding

**Application Steps:**
1. **Identify the problem** - What needs improvement?
2. **List current state** - What exists now?
3. **Identify what to remove** - What can be eliminated?
4. **Prioritize removal** - What removal will have greatest positive impact?
5. **Remove systematically** - Eliminate identified elements
6. **Assess improvement** - Did removal solve or improve the problem?

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Defaulting to "add more" before considering "remove what hurts"
- Removing too much too fast (no baseline to measure)
- Confusing "nice to have" with "essential"
- Not tracking what was removed (can't reverse if needed)
- Stopping at obvious removals without digging deeper

**Output Structure:**
- Problem Statement
- Current State Analysis
- Candidates for Removal
- Removal Impact Assessment
- Prioritized Removal List
- Implementation Plan
- Improvement Assessment

**Example Application:**
```
Problem: "Team velocity is declining despite adding process"
Current State:
- Daily standups (15 min)
- Sprint planning (2 hrs)
- Retrospectives (1 hr)
- Code review meetings (3 hrs/week)
- Architecture review board (1 hr/week)
- Status reports (2 hrs/week)
Candidates for Removal:
- Architecture review board: delays decisions, rubber-stamps anyway
- Status reports: duplicate of standup content
- Code review meetings: could be async
Prioritized Removal:
1. Architecture board → async Slack channel
2. Status reports → eliminated
3. Code review meetings → async PR comments
Result: 6 hrs/week recovered, velocity increased 20%
```
