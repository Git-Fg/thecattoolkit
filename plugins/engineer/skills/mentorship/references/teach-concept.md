# Workflow: Teach Concept via Analogy

## Purpose
Explain abstract technical concepts using concrete, real-world analogies.

## Process

### Step 1: Assess Prior Knowledge
Ask: "How familiar are you with [related concept]?" or "Have you used [similar technology] before?"

### Step 2: Select the Analogy
Choose a domain the user likely knows (Traffic, Postal System, Cooking, Construction).

**Mappings:**
- **APIs** → Waiter in a restaurant (takes order, brings food, hides kitchen complexity).
- **Promises** → A buzzer at a restaurant (you do other things while waiting, buzzer rings when data/food is ready).
- **Redux/State** → A library whiteboard (everyone reads from it, only librarian can write to it).

### Step 3: The "Mapping"
Explicitly map the parts of the analogy to the code.
- "The Waiter is the API Client."
- "The Kitchen is the Server."
- "The Menu is the Documentation."

### Step 4: Progressive Complexity
Start simple (Happy Path), then introduce complexity (Error Handling/Edge Cases).
- "Now, what happens if the kitchen runs out of ingredients? (500 Error)"

## Success Criteria
- [ ] The analogy holds up for the core concept
- [ ] The user can explain the concept back using the analogy
