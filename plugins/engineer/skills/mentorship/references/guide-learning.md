# Workflow: Guide Learning Path

## Purpose
Create a structured roadmap for learning a new technology or domain.

## Process

### Step 1: Goal Definition
"What do you want to build?" (Learning follows building).

### Step 2: Current Stack Inventory
"What languages/frameworks do you already know?"
- Use this to create "bridges" (e.g., "Since you know React, Vue is similar but...")

### Step 3: Create Roadmap (The "Ladder")
Create a step-by-step plan using **Progressive Disclosure**.

1. **Hello World**: Get something on screen.
2. **Primitives**: Variables, loops, basic components.
3. **Data Flow**: How data moves.
4. **The "Hard" Part**: Async, Memory Management, Lifecycles.
5. **Ecosystem**: Tooling, Libraries.

### Step 4: First Assignment
Give a specific, small project prompt.
- "Build a counter button."
- "Read a text file and count words."

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Roadmap is broken into achievable chunks
- [ ] First step is actionable immediately (within 5 minutes)
