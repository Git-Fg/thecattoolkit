### Option 1: Plugin Install (Recommended for Claude Code)

```bash
# Add the marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add Git-Fg/thecattoolkit

# Install the plugin
claude plugin install thecattoolkit
```

Start a new Claude Code session to use the commands and skills.

### Option 2: Manual Install

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/glittercowboy/Git-Fg.git
cd thecattoolkit

# Install commands
cp -r commands/* ~/.claude/commands/

# Install skills
cp -r skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

Commands install globally to `~/.claude/commands/`. Skills install to `~/.claude/skills/`. Project-specific data (prompts, todos) lives in each project's working directory.

## Quick Examples

### Code Review Workflow

```
> Use the code-reviewer agent to review my changes
```

The code-reviewer will:
1. Run `git diff` to see changes
2. Analyze modified files for quality, security, performance
3. Provide findings with severity ratings (Critical, Warning, Suggestion, Positive)
4. Include specific fixes with file:line references

### Strategic Decision Making

```
/thecattoolkit:brainstorm Should we migrate to microservices?
```

The brainstorm command applies strategic thinking frameworks:
- **Auto-detect**: Chooses appropriate frameworks automatically
- **Specific framework**: `/thecattoolkit:brainstorm pareto`
- **Skill-level**: `/thecattoolkit:brainstorm strategic`

### Creating a New Skill

```
/thecattoolkit:create-agent-skill Create a skill for React component testing
```

This will:
1. Invoke the create-agent-skills skill
2. Guide through skill structure (simple vs router pattern)
3. Help with YAML frontmatter and progressive disclosure
4. Offer to create directory structure and files

### Auditing Components

```
# Audit a skill
/thecattoolkit:audit-skill ./skills/my-skill

# Audit a command
/thecattoolkit:audit-slash-command commands/my-command.md

# Audit an agent
/thecattoolkit:audit-subagent agents/my-agent.md
```

Each audit provides:
- Overall assessment
- Critical issues (must-fix)
- Recommendations (should-fix)
- Strengths (what works well)
- Context-specific guidance

### Platform-Specific Development

```
> Build a native macOS menu bar app for monitoring system resources
```

The macos-apps skill provides:
- CLI-only development (no Xcode required)
- "Prove, don't promise" methodology
- Verification with xcodebuild
- Focus on outcomes, not code changes

## Skills

### [Create Plans](./skills/create-plans/)

Hierarchical project planning optimized for solo developer + Claude. Create executable plans that Claude runs, not enterprise documentation that sits unused.

**PLAN.md IS the prompt** - not documentation that gets transformed later. Brief → Roadmap → Research (if needed) → PLAN.md → Execute → SUMMARY.md.

**Domain-aware:** Optionally loads framework-specific expertise from `~/.claude/skills/expertise/` (e.g., macos-apps, iphone-apps) to make plans concrete instead of generic. Domain expertise skills are created with [create-agent-skills](#create-agent-skills) - exhaustive knowledge bases (5k-10k+ lines) that make task specifications framework-appropriate.

**Quality controls:** Research includes verification checklists, blind spots review, critical claims audits, and streaming writes to prevent gaps and token limit failures.

**Context management:** Auto-handoff at 10% tokens remaining. Git versioning commits outcomes, not process.

**Commands:** `/create-plan` (invoke skill), `/run-plan <path>` (execute PLAN.md with intelligent segmentation)

See [create-plans README](./skills/create-plans/README.md) for full documentation.

### [Create Agent Skills](./skills/create-agent-skills/)

Build skills by describing what you want. Asks clarifying questions, researches APIs if needed, and generates properly structured skill files.

**Two types of skills:**
1. **Task-execution skills** - Regular skills that perform specific operations
2. **Domain expertise skills** - Exhaustive knowledge bases (5k-10k+ lines) that live in `~/.claude/skills/expertise/` and provide framework-specific context to other skills like [create-plans](#create-plans)

**Context-aware:** Detects if you're in a skill directory and presents relevant options. Progressive disclosure guides you through complex choices.

When things don't work perfectly, `/heal-skill` analyzes what went wrong and updates the skill based on what actually worked.

Commands: `/create-agent-skill`, `/heal-skill`, `/audit-skill`

### [Create Meta-Prompts](./skills/create-meta-prompts/)

The skill-based evolution of the meta-prompting system. Builds prompts with structured outputs (research.md, plan.md) that subsequent prompts can parse. Adds automatic dependency detection to chain research → plan → implement workflows.

**Note:** For end-to-end project building, consider [create-plans](#create-plans) - it's the more structured evolution of this approach with full lifecycle management (brief → roadmap → execution → handoffs). Use create-meta-prompts for abstract workflows and Claude→Claude pipelines. Use create-plans for actually building projects.

Commands: `/create-meta-prompt`

### [Create Slash Commands](./skills/create-slash-commands/)

Build commands that expand into full prompts when invoked. Describe the command you want, get proper YAML configuration with arguments, tool restrictions, and dynamic context loading.

Commands: `/create-slash-command`, `/audit-slash-command`

### [Create Subagents](./skills/create-subagents/)

Build specialized Claude instances that run in isolated contexts. Describe the agent's purpose, get optimized system prompts with the right tool access and orchestration patterns.

Commands: `/create-subagent`, `/audit-subagent`

### [Create Hooks](./skills/create-hooks/)

Build event-driven automation that triggers on tool calls, session events, or prompt submissions. Describe what you want to automate, get working hook configurations.

Commands: `/create-hook`

## Strategic Thinking Skills

Mental models and frameworks for decision-making, prioritization, and problem analysis.

### [Strategic Thinking](./skills/strategic-thinking/)

Long-term perspective and big-picture analysis with 5 frameworks:
- first-principles - Break down to fundamentals and rebuild
- inversion - Solve backwards (what guarantees failure?)
- second-order - Think through consequences of consequences
- swot - Map strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats
- 10-10-10 - Evaluate across time horizons

Use when making strategic decisions, business planning, or major life choices.

Agent integration: Strategic Thinker agent (opus model)

### [Prioritization](./skills/prioritization/)

Focus resources on high-impact activities with 3 frameworks:
- pareto - Apply 80/20 rule to identify vital few
- one-thing - Find highest-leverage domino action
- eisenhower-matrix - Categorize by urgent/important

Use when overwhelmed with tasks, need clarity on what to do first.

Agent integration: Priority Strategist agent (sonnet model)

### [Problem Analysis](./skills/problem-analysis/)

Deep understanding and root causes with 4 frameworks:
- 5-whys - Drill to root cause by asking why repeatedly
- opportunity-cost - Analyze what you give up by choosing
- occams-razor - Find simplest explanation that fits all facts
- via-negativa - Improve by removing rather than adding

Use when analyzing problems, making constrained choices, or simplifying complexity.

Agent integration: Problem Analyst agent (sonnet model)

---

## Specialized Skills

### [Debug Like Expert](./skills/debug-like-expert/)

Deep analysis debugging mode for complex issues. Activates methodical investigation protocol with evidence gathering, hypothesis testing, and rigorous verification. Use when standard troubleshooting fails or when issues require systematic root cause analysis.

Commands: `/debug`

### [Prompt Engineering Patterns](./skills/prompt-engineering-patterns/)

Master advanced prompt engineering techniques to maximize LLM performance, reliability, and controllability in production. Covers few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting, prompt optimization, template systems, and system prompt design.

---

## Knowledge Domain Skills

Specialized skills for specific technical domains and best practices.

### [Project Analysis](./skills/project-analysis/)

Understand any codebase structure and patterns. Essential for onboarding to new projects or analyzing unfamiliar codebases.

### [Architecture Patterns](./skills/architecture-patterns/)

System design guidance with patterns like Layered Architecture, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal Architecture, Event-Driven Architecture, and CQRS. Includes trade-off analysis templates.

### [Testing Strategy](./skills/testing-strategy/)

Design comprehensive test approaches covering unit tests, integration tests, and E2E testing.

### [Performance Optimization](./skills/performance-optimization/)

Speed up applications and identify bottlenecks with systematic performance analysis techniques.

### [Git Workflow](./skills/git-workflow/)

Version control best practices and conventional commits for professional development workflows.

### [API Design](./skills/api-design/)

REST and GraphQL API patterns, best practices, and design principles.

---

## Hooks

### [Automation Hooks](./hooks/)

Event-driven automation that triggers during Claude Code operations:

- **PreToolUse (Edit/Write)**: File protection and security checks
  - `protect-files.py` - Blocks edits to lock files, .env, .git
  - `security-check.py` - Scans for potential secrets
- **PostToolUse (Edit/Write)**: Auto-formatting
  - `format-on-edit.py` - Formats files on edit (Python with ruff, JS/TS with prettier)

---

## Recommended Workflow

**For building projects:** Use `/create-plan` to invoke the [create-plans](#create-plans) skill. After planning, use `/run-plan <path-to-PLAN.md>` to execute phases with intelligent segmentation. This provides hierarchical planning (BRIEF.md → ROADMAP.md → phases/PLAN.md), domain-aware task generation, context management with handoffs, and git versioning.

**For domain expertise:** Use [create-agent-skills](#create-agent-skills) to create exhaustive knowledge bases in `~/.claude/skills/expertise/`. These skills are automatically loaded by create-plans to make task specifications framework-specific instead of generic.

**Other tools:** The [create-meta-prompts](#create-meta-prompts-1) skill and `/create-prompt` + `/run-prompt` commands are available for custom Claude→Claude pipelines that don't fit the project planning structure.

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Loading

**Symptom:** Commands don't appear after installation

**Solutions:**
1. Verify plugin.json exists and is valid:
   ```bash
   cat .claude-plugin/plugin.json | python3 -m json.tool
   ```

2. Try loading with full path:
   ```bash
   claude --plugin-dir /full/path/to/thecattoolkit
   ```

3. Check Claude Code version (requires 1.0.33+):
   ```bash
   claude --version
   ```

### Commands Not Appearing

**Symptom:** `/help` doesn't show thecattoolkit commands

**Solutions:**
1. Verify command files exist:
   ```bash
   ls commands/*.md
   ```

2. Check YAML frontmatter in commands:
   ```bash
   head -5 commands/your-command.md
   ```

3. Restart Claude Code after adding commands

### Skills Not Triggering

**Symptom:** Skills don't activate automatically

**Solutions:**
1. Check SKILL.md exists:
   ```bash
   ls skills/your-skill/SKILL.md
   ```

2. Verify description includes trigger keywords:
   ```bash
   head -10 skills/your-skill/SKILL.md
   ```

3. Use explicit invocation:
   ```
   > Use the your-skill skill to...
   ```

### Hook Scripts Failing

**Symptom:** Errors on file edits or hooks not running

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Python is available:
   ```bash
   which python3
   ```

2. Test script manually:
   ```bash
   python3 hooks/scripts/protect-files.py < /dev/null
   ```

3. Check CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT variable:
   ```bash
   echo $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT
   ```

4. Review hook configuration:
   ```bash
   cat hooks/hooks.json | python3 -m json.tool
   ```

### Agent Not Found

**Symptom:** "Agent not found" error when invoking

**Solutions:**
1. Check agent file exists:
   ```bash
   ls agents/your-agent.md
   ```
