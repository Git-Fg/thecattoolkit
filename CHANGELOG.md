### Bug Fixes - Incomplete Migration

This release completes the XML to Markdown migration that was incomplete in v1.0.1. Approximately 158 additional files have been converted from XML to proper Markdown headings.

### Fixed

**Phase 1: Router Skills** (4 files)
- Preserved `<intake>` and `<routing>` XML sections only (complex routing logic)
- Converted all other XML to Markdown headings
- Files: create-plans, create-agent-skills, create-subagents, create-hooks

**Phase 2: Expertise Skills** (Complete)
- Converted all XML tags to Markdown in expertise skills
- Files: macos-apps, iphone-apps (SKILL.md and all workflow files)

**Phase 3: Framework Skills** (Complete)
- Converted all XML framework definitions to Markdown
- Files: All frameworks in strategic-thinking/, prioritization/, problem-analysis/

**Phase 4: Reference Files** (Complete)
- Converted XML reference documentation to Markdown
- Files: All reference files with remaining XML tags

### Changed

**YAML Frontmatter Standardization**
- Standardized frontmatter across all agents (added permissionMode where missing)
- Standardized frontmatter across all commands (consistent structure)
- Verified all skills have proper name and description fields

**Cleanup**
- Removed .DS_Store files from all directories

### Migration Notes

If upgrading from v1.0.1, note that:
- XML structure has been fully converted to Markdown (except `<intake>` and `<routing>` in router skills)
- All functionality remains backwards-compatible
- No breaking changes

## [1.0.1] - 2025-01-01

- **debugger** - Systematic bug investigation and fixing with 6-phase protocol
- **docs-writer** - Technical documentation specialist
- **security-auditor** - Security vulnerability detection specialist
- **refactorer** - Code structure improvements and technical debt reduction
- **test-architect** - Comprehensive test strategy design

#### Knowledge Domain Skills (6 new)
- **project-analysis** - Understand codebase structure and patterns
- **architecture-patterns** - System design guidance (Clean Architecture, Hexagonal, Event-Driven, CQRS)

- **api-design** - REST/GraphQL API patterns and best practices

#### Strategic Thinking Skills (3 new)
- **strategic-thinking** - Long-term perspective and big-picture analysis
  - Frameworks: first-principles, inversion, second-order, swot, 10-10-10
  - Use when making strategic decisions, business planning, or major life choices
- **prioritization** - Focus resources on high-impact activities
  - Frameworks: pareto, one-thing, eisenhower-matrix

  - Auto-selects appropriate frameworks based on context
  - Combines multiple frameworks when beneficial
- **/brainstorm command** - Unified entry point for all thinking frameworks
  - Auto-detect mode: Agent analyzes context and suggests frameworks
  - Specific framework mode: Apply named framework directly
  - Skill mode: Apply frameworks from strategic-thinking, prioritization, or problem-analysis

#### Output Mode Commands (4 new)
- **/architect** - System design mode focusing on architecture before code
- **/rapid** - Fast development mode for shipping quickly and iterating
- **/mentor** - Learning mode that explains the "why"
- **/review** - Code review mode with strict quality standards

#### Automation Hooks (3 new)

- **docs-writer** - Added "Use PROACTIVELY when..." pattern and project-analysis skill
- **refactorer** - Added "Use PROACTIVELY when..." pattern
- **debugger** - Added debug-like-expert skill for systematic debugging methodology

**Creation Commands Guidance**
- Added guidance notes to all creation commands explaining when to use each:
  - `/create-plan` - For building projects (hierarchical planning)
  - `/create-meta-prompt` - For Claude→Claude pipelines (staged workflows)
  - `/create-prompt` - For single prompts (simple, one-off)
  - `/create-agent-skill` - For creating new skills
  - `/create-subagent` - For creating specialized agents
  - `/create-slash-command` - For creating commands
  - `/create-hook` - For automation

**Plugin Configuration**
- Updated plugin.json description to reflect expanded capabilities
- Added keywords: orchestration, code-review, security, testing, architecture, debugging
- Updated README with new strategic thinking section

### Removed

**12 consider:* commands** - Consolidated into unified brainstormer:
- Old: `/consider:pareto`, `/consider:first-principles`, etc.
- New: `/brainstorm` with framework-specific or auto-detect modes

### Migration Guide

**Thinking Frameworks:**
- Before: `/consider:pareto` or `/consider:first-principles`
- After:
  - `/brainstorm` - Auto-detect best framework
  - `/brainstorm pareto` - Apply specific framework
  - `/brainstorm strategic` - Use strategic-thinking skill frameworks

### Total Counts
