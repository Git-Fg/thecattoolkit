## [1.0.8] - 2026-01-02

### AI Agent Discoverability Improvements

This release implements the A+D Hybrid methodology for writing descriptions that AI agents can autonomously discover and invoke. All commands, skills, and subagents now use strong calling conditions (MUST/ALWAYS/PROACTIVELY USE) with concrete trigger conditions.

### Changed

**Command Descriptions** (16 commands updated)

All commands now follow the pattern: `[CALLING_CONDITION] when [primary_condition]. Secondary: [edge_cases]`

- `/debug` - "MUST USE when investigating bugs, errors, or unexpected behavior requiring systematic root cause analysis. Secondary: recurring issues, intermittent failures, production outages."
- `/review` - "ALWAYS USE after completing code changes to review quality, identify issues, and ensure standards compliance. Secondary: before merging PRs, when refactoring, after implementing features."
- `/brainstorm` - "PROACTIVELY USE for complex problems requiring structured thinking frameworks, multi-perspective analysis, or strategic insight. Secondary: ambiguous challenges, decisions with trade-offs, situations requiring creative solutions."
- `/create-plan` - "MUST USE when planning projects, phases, or tasks that an AI agent will execute."
- `/create-prompt` - "MUST USE when creating prompts that will be executed by Claude or other AI agents."
- `/create-meta-prompt` - "MUST USE when building prompts that produce outputs for other prompts to consume."
- `/create-slash-command` - "MUST USE when creating custom slash commands, standardizing workflows."
- `/create-subagent` - "MUST USE when creating specialized AI agents, setting up delegation tools."
- `/create-agent-skill` - "MUST USE when working with SKILL.md files, authoring new skills."
- `/create-hook` - "MUST USE when working with hooks, setting up event listeners."
- `/run-plan` - "MUST USE when executing PLAN.md files created by the planning system."
- `/run-prompt` - "MUST USE when executing prompts from .prompts/prompts/ as delegated sub-tasks."
- `/whats-next` - "MUST USE when pausing work and needing to resume later in a fresh context."
- `/audit-skill` - "MUST USE when auditing skills for best practices compliance."
- `/audit-subagent` - "MUST USE when auditing subagents for best practices compliance."
- `/audit-slash-command` - "MUST USE when auditing slash commands for YAML compliance."

**Skill Descriptions** (6 skills updated)

- `api-design` - "MUST USE when designing APIs, creating endpoints, defining error handling."
- `architecture-patterns` - "MUST USE when designing systems, choosing patterns, structuring projects."
- `prompt-engineering-patterns` - "MUST USE when creating prompts for AI agents, structuring constraints."
- `create-meta-prompts` - "MUST USE when building prompts that produce outputs for other prompts."
- `create-plans` - "MUST USE when planning projects, phases, or tasks that an AI agent will execute."
- `create-slash-commands` - "MUST USE when creating custom slash commands, standardizing workflows."

**Subagent Descriptions** (1 updated)

- `plan-executor` - "MUST USE when executing PLAN.md files created by the planning system."

### Added

**Documentation**

- `.claude/description-guidelines.md` - Comprehensive guidelines for writing agent-discoverable descriptions including:
  - A+D hybrid methodology explanation
  - Decision tree for writing descriptions
  - Validation checklist
  - Before/after examples
  - Anti-patterns to avoid

### Benefits

**Improved Autonomous Invocation**: AI agents can now autonomously discover and invoke tools with confidence due to unambiguous activation signals.

**Reduced Hesitation**: Strong calling conditions (MUST/ALWAYS/PROACTIVELY USE) override agent hesitation in borderline cases.

**Better Differentiation**: Each tool has mutually exclusive conditions where appropriate, preventing confusion between similar tools.

**Consistency**: All commands, skills, and subagents follow the same description pattern, making the plugin more predictable.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-01-02

### Architecture Refactoring - "Refine & Relay" Pattern

This release implements a systematic architectural improvement across all slash commands and agent interactions. The "Refine & Relay" pattern optimizes the relationship between main model (cheaper, faster) and specialist agents (more capable, expensive).

### Changed

**Slash Commands - Pre-Flight Controller Pattern**

Commands now act as "Pre-Flight Controllers" that gather context, synthesize it into high-fidelity prompts, then delegate to specialist agents. This prevents agents from wasting their first turn asking basic questions.

- `/brainstorm` - Categorizes requests (Technical/Strategic/Analytical) and adds thinking direction before delegating to brainstormer
- `/debug` - Analyzes git status to identify suspect files, creates targeted investigation directive for debugger
- `/review` - Synthesizes diff stats with user focus to create precise briefing for code-reviewer
- `/audit-subagent` - Validates search results and synthesizes directive for subagent-auditor
- `/audit-skill` - Validates pre-flight checks and synthesizes directive for skill-auditor
- `/create-*` commands - Standardized to "dumb relay" pattern for skill delegation

**Agent Input Handling**

All specialist agents now include explicit "Input Handling" or "Initialization" sections to process synthesized context from commands:

- `debugger.md` - Added Input Handling section to process context injection and adapt to detected language
- `code-reviewer.md` - Added Input Processing section to handle specific paths vs vague requests
- `subagent-auditor.md` - Added Initialization section to read files or ask for clarification
- `skill-auditor.md` - Added Initialization section to validate paths and check SKILL.md existence

### Benefits

**Token Efficiency**: Agents receive targeted context in their first prompt (no "what file?" questions)

**Cost Optimization**: Cheaper main model (Haiku/Sonnet) does synthesis, expensive agent (Opus) executes

**Human Alignment**: Main model translates "vague human" to "precise agent directive"

**Speed**: Bash commands (`!`) execute instantly before model thinking, providing immediate context

### Technical Details

The "Refine & Relay" pattern represents the "Middle Way" between:
- **Dumb Relay**: Main model passes raw input without processing
- **Smart Agent**: Agent does all context gathering and synthesis

Instead: Main model gathers context via bash commands, synthesizes into sharp prompt, delegates to agent.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-01-01

### Bug Fixes - Incomplete Migration

This release completes the XML to Markdown migration that was incomplete in v1.0.1. Approximately 158 additional files have been converted from XML to proper Markdown headings.

### Fixed

**Phase 1: Router Skills** (4 files)
- Preserved `<intake>` and `<routing>` XML sections only (complex routing logic)
- Converted all other XML to Markdown headings
- Files: create-plans, create-agent-skills, create-subagents, create-hooks

**Phase 2: Expertise Skills** (Complete)
- Converted all XML tags to Markdown in expertise skills
- Files: macos-apps, iphone-apps (SKILL.md and all workflow files)

**Phase 3: Framework Skills** (Complete)
- Converted all XML framework definitions to Markdown
- Files: All frameworks in strategic-thinking/, prioritization/, problem-analysis/

**Phase 4: Reference Files** (Complete)
- Converted XML reference documentation to Markdown
- Files: All reference files with remaining XML tags

### Changed

**YAML Frontmatter Standardization**
- Standardized frontmatter across all agents (added permissionMode where missing)
- Standardized frontmatter across all commands (consistent structure)
- Verified all skills have proper name and description fields

**Cleanup**
- Removed .DS_Store files from all directories

### Migration Notes

If upgrading from v1.0.1, note that:
- XML structure has been fully converted to Markdown (except `<intake>` and `<routing>` in router skills)
- All functionality remains backwards-compatible
- No breaking changes
