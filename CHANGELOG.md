All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.5] - 2026-01-02

### Changed

#### Markdown Formatting Behavior

- `format-on-edit.py` - Markdown files now only use markdownlint-cli2 if
  `.markdownlint.jsonc` exists in the project
- Removed prettier fallback for `.md` files
- Projects without markdownlint config will not have markdown auto-formatting

### Benefits

#### Opt-in Markdown Linting

Only enforce markdown rules when explicitly configured

#### No Surprises

Projects without markdownlint config won't have unexpected formatting changes

## [1.1.4] - 2026-01-02

### Changed

#### Markdown Formatting Behavior

- `format-on-edit.py` - Markdown files now prefer prettier, only use markdownlint-cli2
  if `.markdownlint.jsonc` exists in the project
- Added `has_markdownlint_config()` function to search upward for config file

## [1.1.3] - 2026-01-02

### Changed

#### Hook Output Conciseness

- `format-on-edit.py` - Always show `[formatter] formatted file.ext` message
  - Removed stderr redundancy (JSON output is sufficient)
  - Use basename instead of full path
  - Only add error details when formatter returns non-zero
- `type-check-on-edit.py` - Concise output: `[checker] type-checked file.ext` or
  `[checker] type-check failed — error`
  - Removed stderr noise
  - Consistent `[name]` format across all hooks

### Benefits

#### Cleaner Output

One-line confirmation for all formatting actions

#### AI Awareness

Claude always knows formatting happened without verbose noise

## [1.1.2] - 2026-01-02

### Changed

#### Hook Output Verbosity

- `format-on-edit.py` - Reduced hook output verbosity
  - Filter out boilerplate (version info, "Finding:", "Linting:")
  - Only show `additionalContext` when there are errors or actual changes
  - Silent output for clean files to reduce context pollution

### Benefits

#### Reduced Context Pollution

Clean files no longer produce verbose hook output

## [1.1.1] - 2026-01-02

### AI Context Awareness for Hooks

This release adds AI context awareness to PostToolUse hooks, allowing Claude to understand what happened during formatting and type-checking operations.

### Added

**AI Context via JSON Output**

- `format-on-edit.py` - Now outputs JSON with `additionalContext` informing Claude about:
  - Which formatter was run (ruff, prettier, markdownlint, etc.)
  - Whether formatting was successful
  - Any formatter output/errors
- `type-check-on-edit.py` - Now outputs JSON with `additionalContext` informing Claude about:
  - Type check results (passed/failed)
  - Number of issues found
  - Summary of first few errors when issues exist
  - Type checker timeouts or errors

### Changed

**Hook Output Behavior**

- Hooks now output BOTH:
  - stderr messages for user visibility (shown in verbose mode with ctrl+o)
  - JSON with `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` for AI awareness
- Claude agents now automatically know when:
  - A file was formatted successfully
  - Type checking found issues
  - A formatter timed out or wasn't available

### Benefits

**Better AI Awareness:** Claude now knows the results of formatting and type-checking without manual checking

**Automatic Feedback Loop:** When type-checking fails, Claude sees the error summary and can fix issues immediately

**Transparent to Users:** stderr output still provides visibility in verbose mode

### Technical Details

Hooks use the `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` field from the [PostToolUse JSON output schema](https://code.claude.com/docs/hooks#posttooluse-decision-control). This context is added to Claude's conversation context, allowing the AI to respond to hook results autonomously.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-02

### Security & Code Quality Improvements

This release focuses on security hardening and code quality improvements for all automation hooks, following official Claude Code documentation best practices.

### Fixed

**Critical Bug: Mutable Default Argument**

- Removed `optimize-prompt.py` script (dataclass with `metadata: Dict = None` causing TypeError)
- This script was unused and contained a critical runtime bug

**Security: Path Traversal Protection**

- Added `contains_path_traversal()` function to all hooks
- Detects `..` in path components and URL-encoded variants (`%2e%2e`, `%2E%2E`)
- Logs detection and skips silently (permissive mode maintained)

**Code Quality**

- Fixed redundant string splitting in `type-check-on-edit.py` (was splitting 3 times)
- Standardized type annotations to modern `list[str]` syntax (removed `from typing import List`)
- Added proper error logging with `logging.getLogger(__name__)` and `logger.debug()`
- All exception handlers now log with `exc_info=True` for debugging

### Changed

**All Hooks (4 files updated)**

- `protect-files.py` - Added security checks, improved input validation
- `security-check.py` - Added security checks, improved input validation
- `format-on-edit.py` - Added security checks, modern type annotations
- `type-check-on-edit.py` - Added security checks, fixed string splitting bug

**Build Artifacts**

- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude Python cache files (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`, `*.pyd`)

### Benefits

**Enhanced Security:** Path traversal detection prevents malicious file access attempts

**Better Debugging:** All errors now logged with full tracebacks (via `--debug` flag)

**Modern Code:** Uses Python 3.9+ built-in generic types instead of `typing` module

**Documentation Compliance:** All hooks now follow [official Claude Code hooks documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/hooks) best practices

### Migration Notes

No breaking changes. Hooks remain in permissive mode (warn, don't block). Security checks silently skip suspicious paths and log for debugging.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-01-02

### AI Agent Discoverability Improvements

This release implements the A+D Hybrid methodology for writing descriptions that AI agents can autonomously discover and invoke. All commands, skills, and subagents now use strong calling conditions (MUST/ALWAYS/PROACTIVELY USE) with concrete trigger conditions.

### Changed

**Command Descriptions** (16 commands updated)

All commands now follow the pattern: `[CALLING_CONDITION] when [primary_condition]. Secondary: [edge_cases]`

- `/debug` - "MUST USE when investigating bugs, errors, or unexpected behavior requiring systematic root cause analysis. Secondary: recurring issues, intermittent failures, production outages."
- `/review` - "ALWAYS USE after completing code changes to review quality, identify issues, and ensure standards compliance. Secondary: before merging PRs, when refactoring, after implementing features."
- `/brainstorm` - "PROACTIVELY USE for complex problems requiring structured thinking frameworks, multi-perspective analysis, or strategic insight. Secondary: ambiguous challenges, decisions with trade-offs, situations requiring creative solutions."
- `/create-plan` - "MUST USE when planning projects, phases, or tasks that an AI agent will execute."
- `/create-prompt` - "MUST USE when creating prompts that will be executed by Claude or other AI agents."
- `/create-meta-prompt` - "MUST USE when building prompts that produce outputs for other prompts to consume."
- `/create-slash-command` - "MUST USE when creating custom slash commands, standardizing workflows."
- `/create-subagent` - "MUST USE when creating specialized AI agents, setting up delegation tools."
- `/create-agent-skill` - "MUST USE when working with SKILL.md files, authoring new skills."
- `/create-hook` - "MUST USE when working with hooks, setting up event listeners."
- `/run-plan` - "MUST USE when executing PLAN.md files created by the planning system."
- `/run-prompt` - "MUST USE when executing prompts from .prompts/prompts/ as delegated sub-tasks."
- `/whats-next` - "MUST USE when pausing work and needing to resume later in a fresh context."
- `/audit-skill` - "MUST USE when auditing skills for best practices compliance."
- `/audit-subagent` - "MUST USE when auditing subagents for best practices compliance."
- `/audit-slash-command` - "MUST USE when auditing slash commands for YAML compliance."

**Skill Descriptions** (6 skills updated)

- `api-design` - "MUST USE when designing APIs, creating endpoints, defining error handling."
- `architecture-patterns` - "MUST USE when designing systems, choosing patterns, structuring projects."
- `prompt-engineering-patterns` - "MUST USE when creating prompts for AI agents, structuring constraints."
- `create-meta-prompts` - "MUST USE when building prompts that produce outputs for other prompts."
- `create-plans` - "MUST USE when planning projects, phases, or tasks that an AI agent will execute."
- `create-slash-commands` - "MUST USE when creating custom slash commands, standardizing workflows."

**Subagent Descriptions** (1 updated)

- `plan-executor` - "MUST USE when executing PLAN.md files created by the planning system."

### Added

**Documentation**

- `.claude/description-guidelines.md` - Comprehensive guidelines for writing agent-discoverable descriptions including:
  - A+D hybrid methodology explanation
  - Decision tree for writing descriptions
  - Validation checklist
  - Before/after examples
  - Anti-patterns to avoid

### Benefits

**Improved Autonomous Invocation**: AI agents can now autonomously discover and invoke tools with confidence due to unambiguous activation signals.

**Reduced Hesitation**: Strong calling conditions (MUST/ALWAYS/PROACTIVELY USE) override agent hesitation in borderline cases.

**Better Differentiation**: Each tool has mutually exclusive conditions where appropriate, preventing confusion between similar tools.

**Consistency**: All commands, skills, and subagents follow the same description pattern, making the plugin more predictable.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-01-02

### Architecture Refactoring - "Refine & Relay" Pattern

This release implements a systematic architectural improvement across all slash commands and agent interactions. The "Refine & Relay" pattern optimizes the relationship between main model (cheaper, faster) and specialist agents (more capable, expensive).

### Changed

**Slash Commands - Pre-Flight Controller Pattern**

Commands now act as "Pre-Flight Controllers" that gather context, synthesize it into high-fidelity prompts, then delegate to specialist agents. This prevents agents from wasting their first turn asking basic questions.

- `/brainstorm` - Categorizes requests (Technical/Strategic/Analytical) and adds thinking direction before delegating to brainstormer
- `/debug` - Analyzes git status to identify suspect files, creates targeted investigation directive for debugger
- `/review` - Synthesizes diff stats with user focus to create precise briefing for code-reviewer
- `/audit-subagent` - Validates search results and synthesizes directive for subagent-auditor
- `/audit-skill` - Validates pre-flight checks and synthesizes directive for skill-auditor
- `/create-*` commands - Standardized to "dumb relay" pattern for skill delegation

**Agent Input Handling**

All specialist agents now include explicit "Input Handling" or "Initialization" sections to process synthesized context from commands:

- `debugger.md` - Added Input Handling section to process context injection and adapt to detected language
- `code-reviewer.md` - Added Input Processing section to handle specific paths vs vague requests
- `subagent-auditor.md` - Added Initialization section to read files or ask for clarification
- `skill-auditor.md` - Added Initialization section to validate paths and check SKILL.md existence

### Benefits

**Token Efficiency**: Agents receive targeted context in their first prompt (no "what file?" questions)

**Cost Optimization**: Cheaper main model (Haiku/Sonnet) does synthesis, expensive agent (Opus) executes

**Human Alignment**: Main model translates "vague human" to "precise agent directive"

**Speed**: Bash commands (`!`) execute instantly before model thinking, providing immediate context

### Technical Details

The "Refine & Relay" pattern represents the "Middle Way" between:

- **Dumb Relay**: Main model passes raw input without processing
- **Smart Agent**: Agent does all context gathering and synthesis

Instead: Main model gathers context via bash commands, synthesizes into sharp prompt, delegates to agent.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-01-01
